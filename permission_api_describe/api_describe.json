By default from Android O, we don't recreate the activity even the app doesn't specify mcc in configChanges. If the app wants to recreate the activity, specify mcc in recreateOnConfigChanges.mnc2The IMSI MNC has changed, that is a SIM has been detected and updated the Mobile Network Code. By default from Android O, we don't recreate the activity even the app doesn't specify mnc in configChanges. If the app wants to recreate the acvitity, specify mnc in recreateOnConfigChanges.navigation40The navigation type has changed.  Should never normally happen.orientation80The screen orientation has changed, that is the user has rotated the device.screenLayout100The screen layout has changed.  This might be caused by a different display being activated.screenSize400The current available screen size has changed.  If applications don't target at leastBuild.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB_MR2then the activity will always handle this itself (the change will not result in a restart).  This represents a change in the currently available size, so will change when the user switches between landscape and portrait.smallestScreenSize800The physical screen size has changed.  If applications don't target at leastBuild.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB_MR2then the activity will always handle this itself (the change will not result in a restart).  This represents a change in size regardless of orientation, so will only change when the actual physical screen size has changed such as switching to an external display.touchscreen8The touchscreen has changed.  Should never normally happen.uiMode200The global user interface mode has changed.  For example, going in or out of car mode, night mode changing, etc."

Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_ACTION_SEND.actionUnspecified0There is no specific action associated with this editor, let the editor come up with its own if it can. Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_NULL.flagForceAscii80000000Used to request that the IME should be capable of inputting ASCII characters.  The intention of this flag is to ensure that the user can type Roman alphabet characters in aTextViewused for, typically, account ID or password input.  It is expected that IMEs normally are able to input ASCII even without being told so (such IMEs already respect this flag in a sense), but there could be some cases they aren't when, for instance, only non-ASCII input languages like Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, Russian are enabled in the IME.  Applications need to be aware that the flag is not a guarantee, and not all IMEs will respect it. However, it is strongly recommended for IME authors to respect this flag especially when their IME could end up with a state that has only non-ASCII input languages enabled.Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_FORCE_ASCII.flagNavigateNext8000000Used to specify that there is something interesting that a forward navigation can focus on. This is like using actionNext, except allows the IME to be multiline (with an enter key) as well as provide forward navigation.  Note that some IMEs may not be able to do this, especially when running on a small screen where there is little space.  In that case it does not need to present a UI for this option.  Like actionNext, if the user selects the IME's facility to forward navigate, this will show up in the application atInputConnection.performEditorAction(int).Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_NAVIGATE_NEXT.flagNavigatePrevious4000000Like flagNavigateNext, but specifies there is something interesting that a backward navigation can focus on.  If the user selects the IME's facility to backward navigate, this will show up in the application as an actionPrevious atInputConnection.performEditorAction(int).Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_NAVIGATE_PREVIOUS.flagNoAccessoryAction20000000Used in conjunction with a custom action, this indicates that the action should not be available as an accessory button when the input method is full-screen. Note that by setting this flag, there can be cases where the action is simply never available to the user.  Setting this generally means that you think showing text being edited is more important than the action you have supplied.Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_NO_ACCESSORY_ACTION.flagNoEnterAction40000000Used in conjunction with a custom action, this indicates that the action should not be available in-line as a replacement for the \"enter\" key.  Typically this is because the action has such a significant impact or is not recoverable enough that accidentally hitting it should be avoided, such as sending a message.    Note thatTextViewwill automatically set this flag for you on multi-line text views.Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_NO_ENTER_ACTION.flagNoExtractUi10000000Used to specify that the IME does not need to show its extracted text UI.  For input methods that may be fullscreen, often when in landscape mode, this allows them to be smaller and let part of the application be shown behind.  Though there will likely be limited access to the application available from the user, it can make the experience of a (mostly) fullscreen IME less jarring.  Note that when this flag is specified the IME maynotbe set up to be able to display text, so it should only be used in situations where this is not needed.Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_NO_EXTRACT_UI.flagNoFullscreen2000000Used to request that the IME never go into fullscreen mode.  Applications need to be aware that the flag is not a guarantee, and not all IMEs will respect it.Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_NO_FULLSCREEN.flagNoPersonalizedLearning1000000Used to request that the IME should not update any personalized data such as typing history and personalized language model based on what the user typed on this text editing object. Typical use cases are:When the application is in a special mode, where user's activities are expected to be not recorded in the application's history. Some web browsers and chat applications may have this kind of modes.When storing typing history does not make much sense.  Specifying this flag in typing games may help to avoid typing history from being filled up with words that the user is less likely to type in their daily life.  Another example is that when the application already knows that the expected input is not a valid word (e.g. a promotion code that is not a valid word in any natural language).Applications need to be aware that the flag is not a guarantee, and some IMEs may not respect it.normal0There are no special semantics associated with this editor."

Then, if the application has defined thezygotePreloadNameattribute, the Application Zygote will call into that class to allow it to perform application-specific preloads (such as loading a shared library). Therefore, spawning from the Application Zygote will typically reduce the service launch time and reduce its memory usage. The downside of using this flag is that you will have an additional process (the app zygote itself) that is taking up memory. Whether actual memory usage is improved therefore strongly depends on the number of isolated services that an application starts, and how much memory those services save by preloading and sharing memory with the app zygote. Therefore, it is recommended to measure memory usage under typical workloads to determine whether it makes sense to use this flag.There is a limit to the number of isolated services that can be spawned from the Application Zygote; the absolute limit is 100, but due to potential delays in service process cleanup, a much safer limit to use in practice is 50.May be a boolean value, such as \"true\" or \"false\"."

Therefore, spawning from the Application Zygote will typically reduce the service launch time and reduce its memory usage. The downside of using this flag is that you will have an additional process (the app zygote itself) that is taking up memory. Whether actual memory usage is improved therefore strongly depends on the number of isolated services that an application starts, and how much memory those services save by preloading and sharing memory with the app zygote. Therefore, it is recommended to measure memory usage under typical workloads to determine whether it makes sense to use this flag.There is a limit to the number of isolated services that can be spawned from the Application Zygote; the absolute limit is 100, but due to potential delays in service process cleanup, a much safer limit to use in practice is 50.May be a boolean value, such as \"true\" or \"false\"."

Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_ACTION_SEND.actionUnspecified0There is no specific action associated with this editor, let the editor come up with its own if it can. Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_NULL.flagForceAscii80000000Used to request that the IME should be capable of inputting ASCII characters.  The intention of this flag is to ensure that the user can type Roman alphabet characters in aTextViewused for, typically, account ID or password input.  It is expected that IMEs normally are able to input ASCII even without being told so (such IMEs already respect this flag in a sense), but there could be some cases they aren't when, for instance, only non-ASCII input languages like Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, Russian are enabled in the IME.  Applications need to be aware that the flag is not a guarantee, and not all IMEs will respect it. However, it is strongly recommended for IME authors to respect this flag especially when their IME could end up with a state that has only non-ASCII input languages enabled.Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_FORCE_ASCII.flagNavigateNext8000000Used to specify that there is something interesting that a forward navigation can focus on. This is like using actionNext, except allows the IME to be multiline (with an enter key) as well as provide forward navigation.  Note that some IMEs may not be able to do this, especially when running on a small screen where there is little space.  In that case it does not need to present a UI for this option.  Like actionNext, if the user selects the IME's facility to forward navigate, this will show up in the application atInputConnection.performEditorAction(int).Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_NAVIGATE_NEXT.flagNavigatePrevious4000000Like flagNavigateNext, but specifies there is something interesting that a backward navigation can focus on.  If the user selects the IME's facility to backward navigate, this will show up in the application as an actionPrevious atInputConnection.performEditorAction(int).Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_NAVIGATE_PREVIOUS.flagNoAccessoryAction20000000Used in conjunction with a custom action, this indicates that the action should not be available as an accessory button when the input method is full-screen. Note that by setting this flag, there can be cases where the action is simply never available to the user.  Setting this generally means that you think showing text being edited is more important than the action you have supplied.Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_NO_ACCESSORY_ACTION.flagNoEnterAction40000000Used in conjunction with a custom action, this indicates that the action should not be available in-line as a replacement for the \"enter\" key.  Typically this is because the action has such a significant impact or is not recoverable enough that accidentally hitting it should be avoided, such as sending a message.    Note thatTextViewwill automatically set this flag for you on multi-line text views.Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_NO_ENTER_ACTION.flagNoExtractUi10000000Used to specify that the IME does not need to show its extracted text UI.  For input methods that may be fullscreen, often when in landscape mode, this allows them to be smaller and let part of the application be shown behind.  Though there will likely be limited access to the application available from the user, it can make the experience of a (mostly) fullscreen IME less jarring.  Note that when this flag is specified the IME maynotbe set up to be able to display text, so it should only be used in situations where this is not needed.Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_NO_EXTRACT_UI.flagNoFullscreen2000000Used to request that the IME never go into fullscreen mode.  Applications need to be aware that the flag is not a guarantee, and not all IMEs will respect it.Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_NO_FULLSCREEN.flagNoPersonalizedLearning1000000Used to request that the IME should not update any personalized data such as typing history and personalized language model based on what the user typed on this text editing object. Typical use cases are:When the application is in a special mode, where user's activities are expected to be not recorded in the application's history. Some web browsers and chat applications may have this kind of modes.When storing typing history does not make much sense.  Specifying this flag in typing games may help to avoid typing history from being filled up with words that the user is less likely to type in their daily life.  Another example is that when the application already knows that the expected input is not a valid word (e.g. a promotion code that is not a valid word in any natural language).Applications need to be aware that the flag is not a guarantee, and some IMEs may not respect it.normal0There are no special semantics associated with this editor."

Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_ACTION_GO.actionNext5The action key performs a \"next\" operation, taking the user to the next field that will accept text. Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_ACTION_NEXT.actionNone1This editor has no action associated with it. Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_ACTION_NONE.actionPrevious7The action key performs a \"previous\" operation, taking the user to the previous field that will accept text.

Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_ACTION_SEARCH.actionSend4The action key performs a \"send\" operation, delivering the text to its target.  This is typically used when composing a message. Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_ACTION_SEND.actionUnspecified0There is no specific action associated with this editor, let the editor come up with its own if it can. Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_NULL.flagForceAscii80000000Used to request that the IME should be capable of inputting ASCII characters.  The intention of this flag is to ensure that the user can type Roman alphabet characters in aTextViewused for, typically, account ID or password input.  It is expected that IMEs normally are able to input ASCII even without being told so (such IMEs already respect this flag in a sense), but there could be some cases they aren't when, for instance, only non-ASCII input languages like Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, Russian are enabled in the IME.  Applications need to be aware that the flag is not a guarantee, and not all IMEs will respect it. However, it is strongly recommended for IME authors to respect this flag especially when their IME could end up with a state that has only non-ASCII input languages enabled.Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_FORCE_ASCII.flagNavigateNext8000000Used to specify that there is something interesting that a forward navigation can focus on. This is like using actionNext, except allows the IME to be multiline (with an enter key) as well as provide forward navigation.  Note that some IMEs may not be able to do this, especially when running on a small screen where there is little space.  In that case it does not need to present a UI for this option.  Like actionNext, if the user selects the IME's facility to forward navigate, this will show up in the application atInputConnection.performEditorAction(int).Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_NAVIGATE_NEXT.flagNavigatePrevious4000000Like flagNavigateNext, but specifies there is something interesting that a backward navigation can focus on.  If the user selects the IME's facility to backward navigate, this will show up in the application as an actionPrevious atInputConnection.performEditorAction(int).Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_NAVIGATE_PREVIOUS.flagNoAccessoryAction20000000Used in conjunction with a custom action, this indicates that the action should not be available as an accessory button when the input method is full-screen. Note that by setting this flag, there can be cases where the action is simply never available to the user.  Setting this generally means that you think showing text being edited is more important than the action you have supplied.Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_NO_ACCESSORY_ACTION.flagNoEnterAction40000000Used in conjunction with a custom action, this indicates that the action should not be available in-line as a replacement for the \"enter\" key.  Typically this is because the action has such a significant impact or is not recoverable enough that accidentally hitting it should be avoided, such as sending a message.    Note thatTextViewwill automatically set this flag for you on multi-line text views.Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_NO_ENTER_ACTION.flagNoExtractUi10000000Used to specify that the IME does not need to show its extracted text UI.  For input methods that may be fullscreen, often when in landscape mode, this allows them to be smaller and let part of the application be shown behind.  Though there will likely be limited access to the application available from the user, it can make the experience of a (mostly) fullscreen IME less jarring.  Note that when this flag is specified the IME maynotbe set up to be able to display text, so it should only be used in situations where this is not needed.Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_NO_EXTRACT_UI.flagNoFullscreen2000000Used to request that the IME never go into fullscreen mode.  Applications need to be aware that the flag is not a guarantee, and not all IMEs will respect it.Corresponds toEditorInfo.IME_FLAG_NO_FULLSCREEN.flagNoPersonalizedLearning1000000Used to request that the IME should not update any personalized data such as typing history and personalized language model based on what the user typed on this text editing object. Typical use cases are:When the application is in a special mode, where user's activities are expected to be not recorded in the application's history. Some web browsers and chat applications may have this kind of modes.When storing typing history does not make much sense.  Specifying this flag in typing games may help to avoid typing history from being filled up with words that the user is less likely to type in their daily life.  Another example is that when the application already knows that the expected input is not a valid word (e.g. a promotion code that is not a valid word in any natural language).Applications need to be aware that the flag is not a guarantee, and some IMEs may not respect it.normal0There are no special semantics associated with this editor."
